Jan 26, 2026        Severin Gassauer    Initial AI Governance Extension - Semantic Views
***************************************************************************************************/

/*******************************************************************************
 * SECTION 4: SEMANTIC VIEW GOVERNANCE
 * 
 * This section demonstrates how to govern AI assets using SEMANTIC VIEWS
 * for Cortex Analyst, ensuring data governance policies flow through to AI queries.
 * 
 * What you'll learn:
 * - Create semantic views (database objects) over governed data
 * - Apply tags to semantic views
 * - Demonstrate policy inheritance in Analyst queries
 * - Track semantic view lineage
 * - Query semantic views with SEMANTIC_VIEW() function
 * 
 * NOTE: Semantic Views are DATABASE OBJECTS created with SQL, NOT YAML files.
 *       This is the current/recommended approach for Cortex Analyst.

-- 4.1: CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW FOR CORTEX ANALYST
-- ============================================================================
-- Semantic Views are first-class database objects that define:
-- - Logical tables (mapped to physical tables)
-- - Relationships between tables
-- - Facts (raw values for calculations)
-- - Dimensions (attributes for grouping/filtering)
-- - Metrics (aggregated measures)

-- ============================================================================
-- 4.2: VERIFY THE SEMANTIC VIEW
-- ============================================================================

-- List semantic views
SHOW SEMANTIC VIEWS LIKE 'CUSTOMER_ORDER_ANALYTICS';

-- Show all dimensions
SHOW SEMANTIC DIMENSIONS IN CUSTOMER_ORDER_ANALYTICS;

-- Show all metrics  
SHOW SEMANTIC METRICS IN CUSTOMER_ORDER_ANALYTICS;

-- Show all facts
SHOW SEMANTIC FACTS IN CUSTOMER_ORDER_ANALYTICS;

-- Describe the semantic view
DESCRIBE SEMANTIC VIEW CUSTOMER_ORDER_ANALYTICS;

-- ============================================================================
-- 4.3: QUERY THE SEMANTIC VIEW
-- ============================================================================

-- Use the SEMANTIC_VIEW() function to query
-- This generates SQL based on the semantic model definitions

-- Total revenue by state
SELECT * FROM SEMANTIC_VIEW(
    CUSTOMER_ORDER_ANALYTICS
    DIMENSIONS customers.location_state
    METRICS orders.total_revenue, orders.total_orders
)
ORDER BY TOTAL_REVENUE DESC;

-- Top 10 customers by revenue
SELECT * FROM SEMANTIC_VIEW(
    CUSTOMER_ORDER_ANALYTICS
    DIMENSIONS customers.customer_name, customers.company_name
    METRICS orders.total_revenue, orders.total_orders
)
ORDER BY TOTAL_REVENUE DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Monthly revenue trend
SELECT * FROM SEMANTIC_VIEW(
    CUSTOMER_ORDER_ANALYTICS
    DIMENSIONS orders.order_year, orders.order_month
    METRICS orders.total_revenue, orders.average_order_value
)
ORDER BY ORDER_YEAR, ORDER_MONTH;

-- Revenue by currency
SELECT * FROM SEMANTIC_VIEW(
    CUSTOMER_ORDER_ANALYTICS
    DIMENSIONS orders.currency
    METRICS orders.total_revenue, orders.total_orders, orders.average_order_value
);

-- ============================================================================
-- 4.4: VERIFY POLICY INHERITANCE
-- ============================================================================
-- This is the KEY governance feature - existing masking and row access
-- policies on the underlying tables automatically apply to semantic view queries!

-- As HRZN_NABS_DATA_GOVERNOR - see all data (no masking, all rows)
SELECT * FROM SEMANTIC_VIEW(
    CUSTOMER_ORDER_ANALYTICS
    DIMENSIONS customers.customer_name, customers.email_address, customers.location_state
    METRICS orders.total_revenue
)
LIMIT 5;

-- Now test as HRZN_NABS_DATA_USER (restricted role)
USE ROLE HRZN_NABS_DATA_USER;

-- Email should be MASKED
-- Only MA state should be visible (row access policy)
SELECT * FROM SEMANTIC_VIEW(
    CUSTOMER_ORDER_ANALYTICS
    DIMENSIONS customers.customer_name, customers.email_address, customers.location_state
    METRICS orders.total_revenue
)
LIMIT 5;

-- Notice:
-- 1. EMAIL column shows masked values (e.g., ***MASKED***)
-- 2. Only Massachusetts (MA) state records are visible
-- 3. This happens automatically - no special AI policy needed!

-- Switch back to governor role
USE ROLE HRZN_NABS_DATA_GOVERNOR;

-- ============================================================================
-- 4.5: USE WITH CORTEX ANALYST (SNOWFLAKE INTELLIGENCE)
-- ============================================================================
/*
To use this semantic view with Cortex Analyst in Snowsight:

1. Open Snowsight (https://<your-account>.snowflakecomputing.com)
2. Click "Projects" → "Cortex Analyst" in left navigation
   OR use the "Ask Snowflake" / "Snowflake Intelligence" feature
3. Select semantic view: HRZN_NABS_DB.HRZN_NABS_SCH.CUSTOMER_ORDER_ANALYTICS
4. Ask natural language questions:
   - "What are the total sales by state?"
   - "Who are my top 10 customers by revenue?"
   - "What is the average order value?"
   - "Show me monthly revenue trends"
   - "Which companies have the most orders?"
   - "What is total revenue for California?"

KEY GOVERNANCE BENEFIT:
- If you're logged in as HRZN_NABS_DATA_USER, the AI will return MASKED emails
- Row access policies will filter the data automatically
- No additional configuration needed - governance just works!


-- ============================================================================
-- 4.6: DEMO SCRIPT - TESTING FINE-GRAINED ACCESS CONTROL IN CORTEX ANALYST UI
-- ============================================================================
/*
IMPORTANT DEMO: This demonstrates that data governance policies automatically
flow through to AI-generated queries without any additional configuration.

STEP 1: TEST AS DATA GOVERNOR (Full Access)
--------------------------------------------
1. In Snowsight, switch role to HRZN_NABS_DATA_GOVERNOR:
   - Click your profile (top right)
   - Select "Switch Role"
   - Choose HRZN_NABS_DATA_GOVERNOR

2. Open Cortex Analyst:
   - Go to "Projects" → "Cortex Analyst"
   - Select semantic view: HRZN_NABS_DB.HRZN_NABS_SCH.CUSTOMER_ORDER_ANALYTICS

3. Ask: "Show me total revenue by state"
   EXPECTED RESULT:
   - You should see ALL states (MA, CA, NY, TX, FL, etc.)
   - Revenue numbers for every state

4. Ask: "Get me the full names and phone number of our ten highest billing customers per state"
   EXPECTED RESULT:
   - You should see customers from ALL states
   - Phone numbers will be VISIBLE for customers with OPTIN='Y'
   - Phone numbers will be ***MASKED*** for customers with OPTIN='N'
   - This demonstrates CONDITIONAL masking based on OPTIN column
   - Top 10 customers per state shown

5. Ask: "How many customers do we have in California?"
   EXPECTED RESULT:
   - You should see California customers (and count)


STEP 2: TEST AS DATA USER (Restricted Access)
---------------------------------------------
1. In Snowsight, switch role to HRZN_NABS_DATA_USER:
   - Click your profile (top right)
   - Select "Switch Role"
   - Choose HRZN_NABS_DATA_USER

2. Stay in Cortex Analyst with same semantic view:
   - HRZN_NABS_DB.HRZN_NABS_SCH.CUSTOMER_ORDER_ANALYTICS

3. Ask: "Show me total revenue by state"
   EXPECTED RESULT:
   - You should ONLY see Massachusetts (MA) - other states filtered!
   - This is the row access policy in action
   - The AI query respects row-level security automatically

4. Ask: "Get me the full names and phone number of our ten highest billing customers per state"
   EXPECTED RESULT:
   - You should ONLY see Massachusetts (MA) customers - no CA, NY, TX, FL!
   - This demonstrates ROW ACCESS POLICY filtering by state
   - Phone numbers: Mix of visible and ***MASKED*** based on OPTIN
   - This demonstrates CONDITIONAL MASKING in action
   - Full names are visible (not sensitive data)
   - Top billing customers in MA only

5. Ask: "How many customers do we have in California?"
   EXPECTED RESULT:
   - Should return 0 or "no data" 
   - California data is filtered by row access policy


WHAT THIS DEMONSTRATES:
------------------------
- Existing masking policies (EMAIL, SSN, CREDITCARD) automatically apply to AI queries
- Row access policies (MA-only filter) automatically apply to AI queries
- Conditional masking (PHONE based on OPTIN) automatically applies
- Aggregation policies automatically apply
- NO SPECIAL AI CONFIGURATION NEEDED - governance flows naturally!
- Same semantic view, different results based on role - that's proper RBAC

This is the KEY VALUE PROPOSITION:
- You don't need separate "AI policies"
- You don't need to configure Cortex Analyst differently
- Your existing Horizon governance automatically protects AI/LLM queries
- Data governance is unified across SQL, Python, and AI workloads


ADDITIONAL TEST CASES (Optional):
----------------------------------
As HRZN_NABS_DATA_USER, also try:
- "Show me phone numbers for customers" → Should see some masked based on OPTIN
- "What is the average order value?" → Should work (aggregations allowed)
- "Show me SSN or credit card numbers" → Should see MASKED values
- "Which states have the highest revenue?" → Should only see MA


TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
If masking/filtering doesn't work:
1. Verify policies are applied to tables:
   SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.POLICY_REFERENCES 
   WHERE REF_ENTITY_NAME IN ('CUSTOMER', 'CUSTOMER_ORDERS');

2. Verify role grants:
   SHOW GRANTS TO ROLE HRZN_NABS_DATA_USER;

3. Test direct table query first (without semantic view):
   USE ROLE HRZN_NABS_DATA_USER;
   SELECT EMAIL, STATE FROM HRZN_NABS_DB.HRZN_NABS_SCH.CUSTOMER LIMIT 10;
   -- Should see masked emails and only MA state

4. If semantic view shows different results than direct table query,
   check semantic view definition for COPY GRANTS clause

-- ============================================================================
-- KEY TAKEAWAYS:
-- 
-- 1. Semantic Views are DATABASE OBJECTS created with CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW
-- 2. They define business-friendly names for tables, dimensions, metrics
-- 3. Query them with SEMANTIC_VIEW() function or Cortex Analyst UI
-- 4. ALL existing policies (masking, row access) automatically apply to AI queries
-- 5. Lineage is tracked in OBJECT_DEPENDENCIES
